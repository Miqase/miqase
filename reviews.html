		<h3>AMD RYZEN 7 1700x and 1700 CPU Review</h3>

The Ryzen 7 1700X and Ryzen 7 1700 are identical to their big brother the Ryzen 7 1800X in every way aside from base clocks and boost speeds. The Ryzen 7 1700 is the only one of the three that doesn’t have the XFR (eXtended Frequency Range) technology which will raise the base and boost clocks by 100 MHz as long as your cooling is sufficient. Being Ryzen 7 octo-core CPUs they all share the same architecture, cache allotments and PCIe lanes.
The Ryzen 7 CPU is a real workhorse and for the money you really can’t beat it. The price to performance ratio here is incredible when compared to its competition, considering its a third of the price.
My recommendation for any one looking to jump into the AM4 platform at present, would be to stick with some low speed DDR4 2666 or even look for one of the new kits 

<h3>Overclocking</h3>

So what did I see in the real world? I can say that neither the Ryzen 7 1700X or the two Ryzen 7 1700s that I have will hit 4.2 GHz at 1.45v. I tried with air cooling and my custom water loop. It wasn’t a temperature limitation that I was hitting. I was a long way from the max temperature of 95 °C which is where these CPU’s will throttle. As you can see below these were max temperatures for a 4.0 GHz overclock on each of the Ryzen 7 CPUs.

<h3>Be Quiet! Dark Base 900 Pro Case Review</h3>

Be quiet! have introduced a flagship case designed to hold any system, be it air-cooled or water-cooled. In 2016, they launched the original Dark Base 900. The Dark Base 900 Pro is the latest version is the newly launched product. It has a piece of tempered glass in place of a standard side panel. It also contains LED strips to light up your system. The black color case has three trim colors – Black, Silver, Orange.

<h3>Intel Skylake-X Core i7 7820X CPU Review</h3>
Intel’s announcement of the X299 High-End Desktop platform initially had a few people shaking their heads, myself included. It all seemed very rushed and many claimed it to be a response to the recent Ryzen/ThreadRipper line from AMD. Whether it was or wasn’t, we’ll likely never know. What we do know is that it covers a broad line-up of CPUs from the quad core i5 all the way up to the 18 core/36 thread i9. This is the  first time since LGA 1366 that Intel has included quad-core variants on their HEDT  platform and many aren’t quite sure what to make of it.

8 core/16 thread SkyLake-X Core i7 7820X and how it measures up to its bigger brother the i9 7900X as well as some comparisons to the AMD R7 1700X. Right off the top, I can tell you the 7820X has one big advantage: its base speed and overclocking headroom when compared to the AMD Ryzen CPUs which quickly run out of steam at the 4.0 GHz mark. This is already 300 MHz behind the 7820X’s all core turbo speed.

<h3>Specifications and Features</h3>
Below is a list of specifications for the 7820X taken from Intel’s website. Skylake-X processors are based on the 14 nm Tri-Gate 3D production, using a 64-bit instruction set. The 7820X supports quad-channel DDR4 2666 MHz as the standard and up to 128 GB of RAM. You may notice that the L3 cache size has been reduced significantly compared to the 7820X’s Broadwell predecessor. There’s a good reason for that: Intel has reorganized their cache hierarchy in favor of additional L2 cache. The intention of the additional L2 cache (1 MB versus 256 KB per core) is to reduce calls to the L3 cache which is much slower, which in essence should improve efficiency.

The i7 7820X comes with 8 cores and 16 threads with a base clock speed of 3.6 GHz. This is a 400 MHz bump up over the i7-6900K. The turbo frequency is 4.3 GHz on all cores and 4.5 GHz on two cores thanks to Turbo Boost 3.0. So far, on the motherboards I have tested, the CPU basically runs at 4.3 GHz all the time. The TDP of the 7820X is 140 W, so a decent cooling solution is required if you want to run the CPU to its full potential.
