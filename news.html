		<h3>CES 2018: Corsair Unveils New Coolers</h3>

Corsair has put a lot of effort into their revamped AIO coolers, namely the H150i PRO with a 360mm radiator and the H115i PRO equipped with a 240mm radiator. They have really gone the extra mile trying to make the new PRO series the quietest AIO on the shelf. Both coolers come with an updated, compact pump head. It’s quieter than previous models with precise control for quieter start-ups and has the full Corsair RGB logo and RGB ring on the face.

	<h3>CES 2018: New AMD Ryzen+</h3>
AMD announced that their upcoming Ryzen/Vega based APUs and Ryzen+ desktop CPUs will be available in early 2018. Last year at this time AMD was preparing to launch the initial Ryzen CPU based on a newly designed “ZEN” core, promising big leaps in IPC and power savings over the previous generation. They definitely delivered on that promise albeit with a few growing pains. It has taken most of the last year to work out the kinks but that can be expected with a fully overhauled platform.

<h3>Zen+</h3>
The upcoming Ryzen+ is still based on the original ZEN core with an optical shrink from 14 nm to 12 nm. Much is still unknown about the second Zen core except that it’s supposed to be available for desktop in April this year.AMD is also working on Precision Boost 2 technology which in their words “seeks highest possible frequency from environmental inputs and opens new boost opportunities for real-world workloads.”

	<h3>CES 2018: NZXT Launches N7 Z370 Motherboard for Intel Cofee Lake</h3>
Better known for their slick cases, NZXT announced their latest product at CES 2018: a motherboard. The N7 Z370 definitely has NZXT’s distinct, modern design, but does it compete with the big players like ASUS and GIGABYTE? The N7 Z370 comes in either black or white, plus customizable heatsink covers in several colors are also available (including the blue shown in the system above). It’s not just all good looks, the board features a 15-phase power design, fan controller, and two M.2 slots. The fan controller, as well as RGB features, can be controlled with NZXT’s new CAM software.
